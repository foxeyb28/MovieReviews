# MovieReviews
[Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MZ9fm_BDmQp6SfBz9CN1ajKZib_TTZbzY3ZfVyFPgbg/edit#)

AS A Movie-Spectator
I WANT to access a Movie by title and genre with an added bonus of a cocktail suggestion including ingredients plus instuctions on making the cocktail.
SO THAT I can enjoy a great movie and cocktail.

As a movie enthusiast, I want to utilize a Movie APl to access comprehensive information about movies, including details about their release date, genre, cast, crew, plot summaries.
When I integrate the Movie API into my application, I expect to be able to search for movies based on specific criteria such as title, genre, actor, director, or release year. The API should provide me with a list of relevant movies, complete with their corresponding metadata. Also, would like a cocktail suggested with the chosen movie. The cocktail can connect to the movie title ex: The Big Lebowski and cocktail will be a White Russian.

GIVEN a Movie Review App
When I am presented with search options by: title, genre,  
Then the movie options are presented 
when I choose the movie I want to review
Then a suggested cocktail that will pair well with the movie is presented

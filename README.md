AS A Movie-Spectator
I WANT to access a Movie by title and genre with an added bonus of a cocktail suggestion including ingredients plus instuctions on making the cocktail.
SO THAT I can enjoy a great movie and cocktail.

As a movie enthusiast, I want to utilize a Movie APl to access comprehensive information about movies, including details about their release date, genre, cast, crew, plot summaries, and ratings.
When I integrate the Movie API into my application, I expect to be able to search for movies based on specific criteria such as title, genre, actor, director, or release year. The API should provide me with a list of relevant movies, complete with their corresponding metadata. Also, would like a cocktail suggested with the chosen movie. The cocktail can connect to the movie title ex: The Big Lebowski and cocktail will be a White Russian.

GIVEN a Movie Review App
WHEN I search for a Movie
THEN I am presented with search options by: title, genre, ratings 
WHEN I view movie selection 
then I am presented with a age input
when I answer the age requirement 
THEN I am presented with the options to select a cocktail suggestion that will pair well with the movie
